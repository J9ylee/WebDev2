        <h2>Sexism in Gaming</h2>

        <section class="parallax parallax1"></section>

        <p>I have always loved playing video games since I was a little girl. From my pink Nintendo to my pink PC, I learned that the gaming community isn’t welcoming to girls. I was not welcome to jump in on a conversation about a video game because I was either lying or bad at the game. I felt like I was always put in a position to prove myself, but gaming shouldn’t be like that. Why can’t I freely play games as a form of entertainment without people judging me?</p>

        <section class="parallax parallax2"></section>

        <p>The toxic gaming culture leaves women vulnerable, not being able to freely play games with no worries. Women are more likely to receive harassment while playing games online. Marketing research company Bryter released a report that estimates around “40% of female gamers have experienced some form of abuse from male gamers while playing online and 28% have experienced sexual harassment from male or other gamers in the form of objectifying comments or death and rape threats.” As a woman who plays video games, this is not surprising to me. Every time I talk in a team chat, I don’t know if I'll either be sexualized or bullied. It affects the way I play games because, in team-based games, I can’t communicate with my team. “Get back in the kitchen and make me a sandwich!” might sound silly, but it does hurt at the moment, because most girls are just trying to have fun and relax, and comments like that ruin the entire experience. This is a set normal for a lot of men because when men make comments like this, they aren't scared because usually, nobody else sticks up for the woman. Digital Commons Eastern Michigan University in 2015 states, “Griefers are players who get enjoyment not from gameplay, but primarily causing other players to become distracted during gameplay.” This is true for a lot of men because I’ve seen it myself; when a man finds out there’s a girl on their team, they like to do things to sabotage and verbally harass them.</p>

        <p>A lot of this behavior is preventable and easy to track, but it is because the companies don’t think this problem matters at the industry level. According to the Wall Street Journal, “Activision Blizzard CEO Bobby Kotick is said to have been aware of the misogynistic corporate culture for years, but did too little to improve the work environment. He is accused of not only covering up his company's systematic sexism but also contributing to harassing women, discriminating against them, or not taking them seriously.” As a Game Art major dreaming about being in this industry, it does alarm me, but doesn’t stop me. I know when more women get into the industry, we won’t settle for CEOs like Activision. On July 20, 2021, the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing (DFEH) filed a lawsuit in Los Angeles Superior Court against Activision Blizzard, Inc. and related entities. The DFEH set out multiple allegations, but they primarily revolve around numerous instances of sexual harassment, gender discrimination, and retaliation. This happened earlier this year, and it truly opened my eyes because I am an active player of Call of Duty, one of Activision/Blizzard’s games. The company didn’t respect women, and a lot of women don't get respected in Call of Duty chat lobbies. There’s a definite connection, and it's the fact that the people in charge don't see women's issues as their issue, so it never gets fixed.</p>

        <p>Many women seek video games as a form of entertainment or to relax, and it's being taken away from them. I don’t want to be treated special or neglected because I’m a woman. I want to be treated as anyone else. When I’m in the industry, I hope to change the culture because change truly starts from the core.</p>
