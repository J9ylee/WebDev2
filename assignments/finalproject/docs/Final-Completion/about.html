  <summary>Research Artifact 1: User Survey</summary>
  <strong>Introduction</strong>
  <p>Skincare is an essential part of many people's daily routines, yet selecting the right products can be overwhelming due to ingredient concerns, adverse reactions, and misleading marketing. To understand consumer habits and challenges in skincare selection, we conducted a survey exploring how individuals choose products, the difficulties they encounter, and what solutions could improve their confidence in skincare decisions.</p>
  <strong>Methodology:</strong>
  <p>The survey I made collected responses from 29 individuals with varying skincare routines and concerns. It included questions on product selection habits, ingredient awareness, common skin issues, past negative reactions, and desired solutions for safer skincare choices.</p>
  <strong>Key Findings</strong>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Frequency of Skincare Use:</strong> A majority of respondents (over 60%) reported using skincare products daily, while a smaller percentage used them rarely.</li>
    <li><strong>Methods of Product Selection:</strong> Online reviews and word-of-mouth were the most common sources for choosing skincare products. Some respondents also relied on ingredient research and dermatologist recommendations.</li>
    <li><strong>Ingredient Awareness:</strong> While some consumers always check ingredient lists, many only do so occasionally. A subset of respondents reported being unsure about specific ingredient risks.</li>
    <li><strong>Skin Concerns and Negative Reactions:</strong> Common concerns included acne, hyperpigmentation, and sensitivity. Over half of respondents experienced negative reactions such as redness, irritation, and breakouts. Some respondents expressed uncertainty about potential allergens in skincare products.</li>
    <li><strong>Challenges in Product Selection:</strong> Key concerns included the fear of using harmful products, high prices, and difficulty understanding ingredient effects. Some respondents highlighted seasonal skin changes as an additional challenge.</li>
    <li><strong>Preferred Solutions:</strong> Many respondents indicated a need for tools that analyze ingredient safety. Personalized skincare recommendations and dermatologist guidance were also highly requested. A few respondents emphasized the importance of sustainability and ethical sourcing.</li>
  </ul>
  <strong>Insights and Implications</strong>
  <p>The findings suggest that while consumers are interested in making informed skincare choices, they face barriers such as ingredient complexity and fear of adverse reactions. Brands and skincare companies could improve consumer confidence by providing transparent ingredient breakdowns, dermatologist-backed recommendations, and AI-powered tools for personalized product selection. Additionally, integrating sustainability efforts could attract more conscious consumers.</p>
  <strong>Conclusion</strong>
  <p>The survey highlights the need for accessible, reliable resources to help consumers navigate the complexities of skincare. By addressing concerns related to safety, education, and personalization, the industry can foster better consumer trust and satisfaction. Further research could explore how technological solutions, such as mobile apps or AI-driven analysis, could simplify the decision-making process for skincare users.</p>

  <summary>Research Artifact 2: Researching articles or books written by medical professionals</summary>
  <p>When designing a skincare recommendation app, it's essential to incorporate insights from dermatologists and skincare specialists. Key considerations include identifying common allergens, understanding ingredient interactions, and ensuring product recommendations are tailored to individual skin needs.</p>
  <p>One major concern is the presence of food allergens in skincare products, especially for people with atopic dermatitis. Research by Ryczaj et al. (2023) found that many eczema treatments contain major food allergens, increasing the risk of sensitization when applied to inflamed skin. This highlights the need for dermatologists to carefully evaluate product formulations and reinforces the importance of an app that helps users avoid allergens.</p>
  <p>Another issue is the misleading nature of "hypoallergenic" labels. A study by Hiranput et al. (2023) found that many so-called hypoallergenic products still contain common allergens, making it difficult for consumers to trust such claims. This emphasizes the need for an educational component in the app to guide users in choosing products based on ingredient safety rather than marketing terms.</p>
  <p>Beyond allergen awareness, understanding how different ingredients interact is also crucial. Goh et al. (2024) emphasize the benefits of a structured skincare routine—cleansing, treatment, moisturization, and sun protection—for conditions like acne, rosacea, and atopic dermatitis. By incorporating these insights, the app can recommend well-balanced routines that enhance skincare effectiveness.</p>
  <p>Technology also plays a key role in improving skincare recommendations. Research suggests that machine learning and deep learning can personalize product suggestions based on skin characteristics (Nithyadevi, 2024; Lin et al., 2022). Integrating these technologies into the app can help refine recommendations, ensuring users get products suited to their specific skin type, conditions, and potential allergies.</p>
  <p>Ethical sourcing and ingredient transparency are becoming increasingly important. Ajayi et al. (2024) emphasize the need for sustainable and ethically sourced skincare ingredients, which not only benefit consumers but also promote environmental responsibility. By incorporating ethical considerations, the app can educate users on making conscious skincare choices.</p>
